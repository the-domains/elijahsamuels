Study with Elijah - Private Lessons

Elijah has been teaching privately and in groups for over ten years. He has always enjoyed working with students and watching their progress. The best part is when the student "gets it" and achieves the sense of accomplishment. 

Currently, he is the woodwinds professor at the[University of Colorado Denver (UCD)][0].

Elijah teaches saxophone, clarinet, flute and oboe. After a student has gone through their first method book (Yamaha/Rubank/Standard of Excellence) and can play the chromatic scale, we move on to their respective book. Below are links and pictures for reference. Each book has lesson/practice schedule for students to know what to work on and ensuring years of success. Later, other books are incorporated as well. These include: clarinet, 32 Etudes by Rose; oboe, Oboe Method (Complete) by Barret; flute, Complete Method for the Flute; saxophone, various books focusing on jazz improvisation and jazz etudes.

Lessons focus on tone, technique, musical expression, theory and aural skills. Learning an instrument the correct way, achieving the easiest and fastest results, from the ground up. Creating short and long term goals and how to accomplish them. Consistent duet practice simulating ensemble skills such as blending, pitch matching and listening for time. How to successfully prepare for auditions and festivals and win.
